Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a versatile and seasoned developer proficient in an array of technologies. With a strong foundation in PHP 8, particularly leveraging Symfony 5 for robust web applications, I navigate the web landscape with finesse using Typescript in conjunction with NodeJs. My skills extend to a complete understanding of the HTTP request lifecycle, ensuring seamless interactions between users and systems.

In the database realm, I wield the power of both MySQL and MongoDB, managing data with precision. Git bash is my trusty companion for version control, while Docker orchestrates my applications with efficiency. I hop down the RabbitMQ hole for message queueing, aligning with architectural paradigms like POO, MVC, and Ports and Adapters.

A champion of testing, I ensure the resilience of my creations, guided by a command over Linux CLI. Integrating RESTful APIs seamlessly, I dance through JS frameworks like Vue.js, Express, and React, while my designs sparkle with responsiveness and cross-browser finesse, thanks to CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, Materialize, and Bulma.

In the realm of continuous integration, Jenkins propels my projects forward with streamlined CD/CI processes. This journey through the digital cosmos encompasses not just development but a harmonious integration of technology, architecture, and design. ðŸš€âœ¨
